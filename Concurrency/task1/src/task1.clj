;Given an alphabet in form of a list containing 1-character strings and a number N. Define a function that
;returns all the possible strings of length N based on this alphabet and containing no equal subsequent
;characters.
;Use map/reduce/filter/remove operations and basic operations for lists such as str, cons, .concat, etc.
;No recursion, generators or advanced functions such as flatten!
;Example: for the alphabet ("Ð°" "b " "c") and N=2 the result bust be ("ab" "ac" "ba" "bc" "ca" "cb") up to
;permutation.
